<h3> Spirit: Stallion of Cimarron </h3>
<p> This movie was part of my childhood. It is a story of a horse with a great narration. Great music, great story. It will never be forgotten, plus the horse, Spirit, is so handsome. </p>
<h3> 1 Litre of Tears </h3>
<p> This is not a movie, it is a Japanese series. A story of a highschool girl who got a rare neuro-degenarative illness. She has a great life until her illness got her. She is a very active girl, she participates in every extra-curricular activities. She helps her family, as the eldest daughter. As the sickness got her, she is unable to do those things anymore. She battles the life she has with courage. </p>
